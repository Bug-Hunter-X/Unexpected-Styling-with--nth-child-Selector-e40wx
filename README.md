# Unexpected Styling with :nth-child Selector in CSS
This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `:nth-child` selector in CSS. The provided `bug.css` file contains an incorrect formula within the `:nth-child` selector, causing unexpected styling of list elements. The `bugSolution.css` shows the corrected version.

**Problem:**
The `:nth-child` selector in `bug.css` only styles every other list item, leaving the others unstyled. This is likely due to an error in the formula used within the selector.

**Solution:**
The `bugSolution.css` file corrects this by using the appropriate formula in the `:nth-child` selector to style all desired list items correctly.
